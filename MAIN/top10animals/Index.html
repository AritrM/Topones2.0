        <h2 class="col"><li>Lion</li></h2>
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lion"><img src="https://www.earth.com/assets/_next/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcff2.earth.com%2Fuploads%2F2023%2F08%2F09120044%2Fafrican-lion_face-closeup_1medium-1400x850.jpg&w=1200&q=75">

        <p> The lion is a large and powerful cat that is found in Africa and Asia. It is the second-largest living cat after the tiger. Lions are social animals that live in groups called prides. A pride usually consists of related females, their offspring, and a few adult males. Lions are carnivores and their main prey includes large herbivores such as zebras, wildebeest, and buffalo. Lions are also known for their distinctive roar, which can be heard up to eight kilometers away.
            Lions are an important part of the African ecosystem. They help to control the populations of herbivores, which can help to prevent overgrazing. Lions are also a popular tourist attraction, and they play an important role in the economies of many African countries.</p>

            The opossum, often called "possum" in North America, is a marsupial native to the Americas. Known for its adaptability, it thrives in various habitats, including forests, urban areas, and rural landscapes. The Virginia opossum is the only marsupial found in the United States and Canada. These nocturnal creatures have a distinctive appearance with grayish fur, a pointed snout, and a prehensile tail used for climbing and balance.

Opossums are omnivorous, feeding on fruits, insects, small animals, and even carrion. They play a vital ecological role by controlling pests and cleaning up dead organic matter. When threatened, they exhibit "playing possum," a unique defense mechanism where they feign death to deter predators.

Despite being misunderstood and sometimes considered pests, opossums are harmless and beneficial. Their immune systems can combat venomous snake bites, and they rarely contract rabies, making them fascinating and ecologically important animals.

        <h2 class="col"><li>Hornysaurus</li></h2>
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhinoceros"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/69/Black_Rhino_at_Working_with_Wildlife.jpg/330px-Black_Rhino_at_Working_with_Wildlife.jpg">

        <p>
            The rhinoceros, or as some might playfully call it, the "Hornysaurus," is a magnificent giant of the animal kingdom, best known for its signature horn or horns atop its snout. With a prehistoric vibe, it’s like a living dinosaur stomping through savannas, grasslands, and forests. These hulking beasts come in several species, like the black rhino and white rhino in Africa, or the Indian and Javan rhinos in Asia.

The "Hornysaurus" thrives on a diet of grasses, shrubs, and leaves, using its sharp sense of smell and hearing to navigate its world. Its tough armor-like skin gives it an indomitable look, but don't let that fool you—these gentle herbivores are vulnerable due to habitat loss and poaching for their prized horns.

Despite their heavy, tank-like build, rhinos can charge at speeds of up to 30 mph! They're the true prehistoric warriors of the modern era.

        <h2 class="col"><li>Anaconda</li></h2>
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anaconda"><img src="https://i.natgeofe.com/k/1fb6fee3-db45-4976-90b0-67a6ad6821a2/anaconda-water_3x2.jpg">

        <p>
            The anaconda, a name that sends shivers down spines, is a massive predator lurking in the dark waters of South America's Amazon basin. These serpentine giants, especially the green anaconda, are among the heaviest snakes in the world, stretching over 20 feet in length and weighing up to 500 pounds.

Silent and calculating, anacondas are ambush predators, lying in wait beneath murky water until their unsuspecting prey comes too close. With lightning speed, they strike, coiling their muscular bodies around their victim and squeezing with immense force. Their constriction is so powerful that it halts blood flow, suffocating the prey within minutes. Fish, caimans, capybaras, and even jaguars fall victim to their crushing grip.

In the dense jungle, the anaconda reigns as an apex predator, its dominance unchallenged. Few creatures can match its raw power and deadly precision, making it a true terror of the wild.

"The air smells different tonight. It's quiet—too quiet. Every rustle of leaves feels like a warning, every snap of a twig like a death knell. They've whispered his name, the humans, in hushed tones. Salman... Khan. The one who hunts us.  

He walks not like the others. He doesn't need hunger to guide him, nor the thrill of survival. No, his reasons are his own, and they are deadly. My brother, my cousin, my friends—they didn’t see him coming. One moment, they grazed in the open meadow; the next, they were gone, their lives snuffed out like fragile flames.  

We are just shadows to him, fleeting shapes in his world of triumph and trophies. But I am no shadow—I am flesh, blood, fear, and memory. And I will not step into the light." 

*The deer pauses, eyes wide, heart pounding.*  

"Perhaps tonight is my night. Or perhaps I will run, faster than the wind, away from the name that strikes terror in my soul. But for how long? How long can I escape the hunter?"
