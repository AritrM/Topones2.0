        <p style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">Salmon are fascinating fish that live in both freshwater and saltwater. They are born in freshwater rivers and streams, but they spend most of their lives in the ocean. When it's time to reproduce, salmon return to their birthplace to spawn. This incredible journey is called migration.
